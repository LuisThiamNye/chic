Notes:
findLoadedClass finds a class *initialised* by the class loader.
A CL of a function class can inadvertently initialise a class via Class/forName
so that new classes of the same name will not be visible assuming findLoadedClass
is checked before the class cache (Clojure's impl).
For initialising classes:
- Public: Class/forName(3)
- Protected: resolveClass (or loadClass(2))
